CONCLUSIONS
----------------------------
Which model had the best balanced accuracy score?
Answer:A combination over- and under-sampling algorithm SMOTEENN seems to have the best score
----------------------------
Which model had the best recall score?
Which model had the best geometric mean score?
Answer:SMOTE algorithm got the best recall and geometric mean score.
However, it was observed using low-dimensional data that simple undersampling tends to outperform SMOTE in most situations. For credit risk SMOTE seems beneficial but less effective than simple undersampling for low-dimensional data, while it performs very similarly to uncorrected SVM and generally much worse than undersampling for high-dimensional data
